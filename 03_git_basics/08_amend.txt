FIXING MISTAKES WITH AMEND:
(amend - enmendar)
Suppose you just made a commit and then realized you forgot to include a file. Or maybe you made a typo in the commit message that you want to correct. Rather than making a brand new separate commit, you can "redo" the previous commit using the --amend option in the commit command. 

git commit --amend

This only works for the previous commit. 

If we've already committed and we want to add a forgoten file, we can add the file to the staging area and then, run the git commit --amend command. It will open the text editor in case we want to change also the commit message.
